        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <div id="Research-Context">
        <p>
          <b>Research Context.</b> Engineered immune-cell therapies have transformed oncology
          by demonstrating that synthetic genetic reprogramming can endow effector cells with
          potent, tumor-specific cytotoxicity <a href="#link">[1]</a>. Among these, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
          T-cell therapy stands as the most successful example—six products have gained 
          regulatory approval to date for the treatment of aggressive malignancies <a href="#link">[2]</a>, such as
          relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma <a href="#link">[3-4]</a> and multiple myeloma <a href="#link">[5-6]</a>. This 
          approach harnesses a patient’s own immune system to selectively recognize and 
          eliminate tumor cells, overcoming limitations of traditional cancer treatments 
          such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, which often lack selectivity and 
          efficacy against advanced or disseminated disease. Reflecting its impact, the 
          global cell therapy market—estimated at US$25 billion in 2025—is projected to 
          exceed US$117 billion by 2034, driven by expansion into solid tumors <a href="#link">[7]</a>, 
          autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these clinical successes, the field remains constrained by a fundamental
          manufacturing bottleneck. As of June 2023, more than 1300 clinical trials of CAR-T
          and related therapies were registered, approximately 93% of which employ autologous
          manufacturing pipelines <a href="#link">[8]</a>. Such patient-specific production is logistically fragile and
          economically prohibitive (US$0.4–1 million per treatment <a href="#link">[8]</a>), limiting access to roughly
          20% of prescribed patients <a href="#link">[9-10]</a>. Moreover, in real-world settings, manufacturing
          delays are so severe that ∼ 7% of patients die before receiving their infusion <a href="#link">[11]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core challenge lies in the transfection of primary immune cells—a critical step
          for introducing chimeric receptors or enabling precise genome edits. Current 
          delivery modalities impose intrinsic trade-offs: (1) Viral vectors suffer from 
          limited cargo capacity (∼ 5–15 kb), risks of random genomic integration, 
          immunogenicity, and costly cGMP-scale production <a href="#link">[12-13]</a>. (2) Bulk electroporation 
          requires extremely high electric fields (tens to hundreds of kVcm−1), causing 
          Joule heating, calcium dysregulation, and transcriptional perturbations that 
          compromise cell viability and function <a href="#link">[14-15]</a>. Furthermore, current treatment relies 
          on centralized production models due to labor-intensive manual production and the 
          need to maintain consistent quality and minimize product variability. Additionally, 
          QA/QC protocols are implemented due to concerns from the viral nature of the 
          treatment. This contributes to long wait times and necessitates cryopreservation, 
          which can render some patients ineligible due to rapid deterioration in health and 
          reduction in CAR-T cell viability before infusion. Current solutions to address 
          these challenges include automated devices such as CliniMac’s Prodigy and
          Thermofisher CTS xenon system, but they are designed to produce one batch of dose per 
          cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the U.S. FDA projecting 10–20 new cell and gene therapy approvals annually
          by 2025 and the allogeneic immune-cell therapy market expected to grow at a CAGR
          of ∼ 27.4%, there is an urgent need for scalable, non-viral, multipayload transfection
          technologies that preserve cellular integrity and integrate seamlessly into closed-loop
          automation.
          
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Problem-Statement">
        <p>
          <b>Problem Statement.</b> This demand motivates a new manufacturing paradigm: a
          universal, automated bioreactor platform capable of producing off-the-shelf immune
          effector cells at scale—decoupled from viral intermediates, engineered for high
          throughput and low-perturbation delivery, and designed to accelerate the industrial
          translation of next-generation cell therapies.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Project-Objective">
        <p>
          <b>Project Objective.</b> In this project, we aim to streamline and automate the
          transfection workflow for producing allogeneic immune cells. Current manufacturing
          pipelines for CAR-T therapy remain expensive, labour-intensive, and centralized, 
          creating high costs, quality variability, and long production cycles. By developing an
          integrated automated system, we seek to reduce production costs, ensure consistent
          product quality, and shorten vein-to-vein time—ultimately enabling decentralized and
          more accessible manufacturing of immune-cell therapies. Within the team, Tianmu
          will lead the development of the automation backbone, focusing primarily on the
          design and optimization of the media-transportation system. Celeste will concentrate
          on engineering the transfection module. Both subsystems will be jointly integrated
          into a cohesive automated platform.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Project-Scope">
        <p>
          <b>Project Scope.</b> Because the central objective is automation, our validation 
          strategy emphasizes engineering performance rather than deep biological 
          characterization. Specifically, our target milestones are: (1) improved recovery 
          efficiency—minimizing residual volume and achieving a recovery rate greater than 50%; 
          (2) robust, stable, and controllable system operation with a total processing time below 
          10 minutes; and (3) low system-induced cell loss, maintaining cell viability above 70%
          when operating without electroporation. Initial testing will be performed using Jurkat 
          cells, an immortalized T-cell line with a rapid doubling time (approximately 1–2 days), 
          making it suitable for repeated prototyping cycles. The combined evaluation across 
          recovery, stability, and viability will determine whether the platform is ready for 
          downstream optimization toward bedside or on-bench automated manufacturing of immune cells.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an additional enhancement, we aim to incorporate experiments in vitro once the
          engineering benchmarks are met. This may include optimizing system parameters for
          transfection of primary human T cells using fluorescent dyes or non-functional protein
          cargo, thereby producing a prototype that is immediately ready for future biologically
          intensive refinement.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Novelty-and-Contribution">
        <p>
          <b>Novelty and Contribution.</b> Our work presents three key advances over existing
          approaches: (1) We automate a non-viral transfection pipeline built on nanostructured
          interfaces that can be manufactured at comparatively low cost. The goal is
          to deliver a next-generation, scalable, and automated non-viral transfection 
          platform that can serve both clinical (bed-side) and research (on-bench) applications. No
          equivalent system currently exists on the market; our prototype therefore lays the
          foundational groundwork for a future universal immune-cell manufacturing device.
          (2) We expand our earlier single-well prototype into a 96-well system, increasing 
          production throughput by up to 96-fold. The redesigned platform incorporates standard
          laboratory consumables—including 96-well plates, pipette tips, and common medical
          springs—to ensure compatibility with existing laboratory workflows and enhance 
          clinical utility. (3) We introduce an innovative shift from media-based to 
          container-based transportation. This approach mitigates cell loss and residual 
          accumulation, two common issues in current bioreactor designs. By ensuring that cells are transferred in a
          highly preserved state, this method improves cell viability and significantly compresses
          the overall manufacturing timeline.

              two cases---including that patients travel to a centralized facility where the full 
              cycle of CAR-T production can be performed, and that patients travel to a facility

          <p>
            <b>Device Fabrication.</b> We successfully designed, manufactured, assembled, 
            and tested a fully automated electroporation prototype that forms the mechanical 
            backbone of our non-viral immune-cell engineering platform <a href="#Figure-2">Fig2</a>. 
            The system integrates four major subsystems: a linear conveyor belt driven by a 
            stepper motor with a positional precision of 0.1~mm, a reaction platform designed 
            to secure the sample reservoir and standard 96-well electroporation plates, a 
            two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) sample transporter, and a vertically aligned electrode 
            array composed of uniform-length electrodes. Together, these modules enable 
            programmable sample transportation, accurate plate positioning, and a consistent 
            electrode--cell interface crucial for reproducible electroporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The linear conveyor belt was adapted from a commercially available product and 
            mechanically modified to provide precise, automated shuttling of plates across 
            processing stations. The reaction platform was custom-fabricated from steel plates 
            and soldered to form a rigid, dimensionally accurate base compatible with standard 
            wet-lab consumables. The two-DOF sample transporter originated from a 
            perfume-injection mechanism; the original dispensing assembly was removed and 
            replaced with an eight-channel springe-based sampling array, allowing automated 
            media acquisition and delivery at tunable heights and lateral positions to 
            accommodate potential design iterations. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The electrode array was manufactured using a multistep workflow. A 5~mm-thick 
            white steel plate was first drilled to create a 2~mm hole array. Threaded screw 
            holders (2~mm outer diameter, 0.5~mm inner diameter) were then soldered into each
            hole, through which electrode wires were threaded and fixed in place. The back 
            side of the assembly was sealed by soldering a cap, ensuring uniform electrode 
            length, stable electrical continuity, and robust structural integrity.
          </p>

          <p>
            In parallel, we iterated the electroporation substrate to improve usability, 
            biocompatibility, and leak prevention. The assembly process was redesigned to 
            eliminate leakage, and the previous use of medical-grade tape as a bonding component 
            was replaced with biocompatible adhesive to enhance reliability and ease of use. The 
            ITO (indium tin oxide) plate was further modified to ensure efficient current 
            conduction from its base to the top surface. Conductive tape was applied and folded 
            along the rim of the ITO plate, and a two-layer adhesive strategy was implemented: 
            an initial layer of medical-grade glue was applied to isolate any non-biocompatible 
            tape residues, followed by a second adhesive layer bonding the ITO plate to the cargo 
            channel. Approximately 2~mm of conductive tape was intentionally left on the top 
            surface to preserve electrical contact, with careful control taken to avoid bubble 
            formation or tape overlap.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cargo channel was fabricated using MultiJet Printing (MJP).
            Although functional, the printed walls displayed warping due to low rigidity of 
            thin polymer sections. To ensure greater dimensional stability and sealing 
            performance during electroporation, we initiated development of an acrylic-based 
            version with improved structural stiffness. The 96-well plate and the MJP-printed 
            cargo channel have been fully procured, and procurement of the holder and metal 
            plate is underway following verification of the automated backbone's performance
              and design integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collectively, these engineering efforts yielded a fully fabricated, mechanically 
            validated, wet-lab-ready electroporation prototype integrating high-precision motion 
            control, a biocompatible and leak-free electroporation substrate, reliable current 
            delivery through a modified ITO interface, and a refined cargo transport system. 
            This completed prototype establishes the foundation for subsequent optimization and 
            testing.

            <b>Device Test.</b> This semester, we validated the mechanical and operational 
            robustness of the automated transfection platform as a prerequisite for biological 
            experimentation. System-level stability was assessed through thirty consecutive 
            automated runs, during which only a single failure was observed; importantly, this 
            failure was traced to temporary cable interference and has since been resolved 
            through hardware rerouting. Across all successful runs, the device demonstrated 
            consistent temporal performance, completing each automated cycle in 
            556 &plusmn; 12 s, indicating a high level of reproducibility in the 
            actuation sequence, media handling, and control logic. Collectively, these tests 
            confirm that the automation backbone is stable enough to support downstream wet-lab 
            studies.
          </p>

          <p>
            In parallel, we performed theoretical and empirical validation of the titanium 
            electrodes employed during electroporation. First, we simulated <i>in silicon</i> 
            the electric field and average electric field strength at transfection membrane and 
            found that across all meshes, the average electric field strength remained 
            negligibly different (p > 0.99; Mean Square Difference < 0.1 V/m; 
            <a href="#Figure-3">Fig.3c</a>Top Right). Next, theoretical computation confirmed pulsed 
            operation under the anticipated voltage and buffer conditions induced negligible 
            release of Ti<sup>4+</sup> ions, supporting the suitability of titanium as a 
            biocompatible anode material within the RPMI-based electroporation environment.
            Dimensional calibration of the mechanical assembly further verified that all 
            modular components fall within their designed tolerance envelopes, ensuring that 
            translational, rotational, and compression mechanisms operate without unintended 
            mechanical interference. These combined validations establish that the device 
            satisfies the machining precision and electrochemical safety requirements 
            necessary for biological deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this foundation, the next stage of evaluation will focus on biological 
            readiness. The first objective is to quantify cell and media recovery throughout 
            the automated workflow, thereby demonstrating that the system can reliably execute
            the fluidic and mechanical steps that precede electroporation. This begins with a
            volume-recovery assay using water or PBS for rapid iteration and will be followed 
            by recovery tests using Jurkat cells in the absence of nanostraw membranes or 
            cargo to evaluate potential cell loss. Once recovery performance is confirmed, 
            the platform will be used to perform full transfection assays. Jurkat cells will 
            serve as the initial biological model, enabling verification that the device can 
            deliver fluorescent dyes or reporter proteins with measurable efficiency. 
            Subsequent experiments will extend to primary human T cells, where fluorescent 
            and functional protein delivery will allow us to assess the translational
            relevance of the system for immunotherapeutic manufacturing.

            Together, the validated mechanical reliability, electrochemical safety, 
            dimensional precision, and the structured biological testing pipeline position 
            our platform as a wet-lab-ready prototype. The device is now functionally 
            prepared for transfection-focused iteration and represents a solid foundation 
            for future refinement toward clinically oriented non-viral engineering of CAR-T cells.

        <h2>4. Discussion</h2>
        <div id="Limitations">
          <p>
            <b>Limitations</b> Meanwhile, we would like to point out the limitations of our work. 
            First, the current prototype does not yet support automated control of the electrical 
            pulse. In the present design, the electroporation voltage remains continuously 
            applied, and the effective field strength experienced by cells is modulated 
            indirectly by adjusting the distance between the titanium electrodes and the 
            ITO substrate. While this quick fix enables preliminary testing, it provides 
            limited temporal specificity and does not reflect the pulsed-field regimes required 
            for optimal transfection efficiency. A more robust solution will involve integrating 
            a GPIO-controlled, programmable power delivery module to enable precise timing, 
            amplitude modulation, and waveform control during electroporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, a dimensional mismatch potentially remains between the electroporation 
            substrate and the media transporter. At this stage, positional calibration relies 
            on identifying appropriate coordinates in manual mode and subsequently updating the 
            automated control script with manually tuned parameters. Although functional, this 
            approach is not scalable and introduces susceptibility to small mechanical 
            deviations. To minimize the risk of damaging the fragile titanium electrodes during 
            alignment, we also employ low-cost steel prototypes during position tuning. Future 
            iterations will require tighter dimensional standardization between subsystems or 
            the incorporation of active sensing methods to ensure repeatable, self-correcting 
            alignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A third potential limitation concerns the presence of residual media within the 
            cargo channel or sampling interface. Variability in fluid acquisition and expulsion 
            can arise from suboptimal springe motion profiles, leading to inconsistent recovery 
            volumes or retention of trace liquid between cycles. This may be addressed by 
            further refining movement speed, acceleration, and positioning parameters for each 
            fluid-handling operation. Additionally, adopting disposable pipette tips as 
            intermediate media carriers may enhance reliability and reduce cross-contamination 
            risk while providing a more flexible and replaceable interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, while these limitations do not compromise the functional readiness of the 
            current prototype, addressing them will be critical for advancing the platform 
            toward high-precision, reliable, and fully automated non-viral transfection 
            suitable for routine experimental or translational use.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Future-Work">
          <p>
            <b>Future Work</b> Looking ahead, we will move beyond addressing the limitations 
            outlined above to strengthen both the engineering rigor and biological performance 
            of our platform, ensuring a smooth transition toward a robust, fully automated 
            electroporation system. Our efforts will center on two parallel streams: validating 
            the automated backbone and completing the engineering characterisation of the 
            electroporation module. (1) we will quantitatively assess cell recovery across the 
            entire workflow, confirming that media volume and cell number are preserved and 
            that viability remains uncompromised, following standardized Trypan blue–based 
            counting protocols. Once the stability of the automated backbone is confirmed, 
            we will proceed with staged biological validation: We will first evaluate 
            electroporation performance using Jurkat cells, delivering fluorescent dyes and 
            fluorescent proteins as initial readouts. Optionally as a bonus, we will then 
            extend these experiments to primary T cells, incorporating the same cargo plus 
            functional proteins to assess the system’s translational potential. Detailed 
            protocols for all experiments described here is provided in the Appendix. 
            (2) Along with the <i>in vitro</i> experiment, we will undertake a comprehensive 
            engineering evaluation of the electroporation subsystem, verifying uniform current 
            distribution across the titanium electrodes, ensuring the absence of fluid seepage 
            within the full consumables assembly (well plate, nanostraw membrane, cargo 
            channel, and ITO substrate), and, where applicable, characterising electric-field 
            uniformity across individual wells during Jurkat and T cell electroporation. In 
            addition, we will re-examine their integration within the automated framework to 
            ensure mechanical compatibility, electrical stability, fluidic reliability, and 
            software–hardware synchronization prior to initiating the next iteration of 
            prototyping.
