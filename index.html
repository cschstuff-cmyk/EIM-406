        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Engineered immune-cell therapies remain constrained by high-cost, labour-intensive, and centralized manufacturing pipelines, with non-viral transfection representing a major bottleneck. To address this, we developed a fully automated, non-viral transfection platform designed as a universal backbone for scalable, off-the-shelf immune-cell manufacturing. Our system integrates conveyor-based plate transport, syringe-driven media handling, and a redesigned electroporation module incorporating a nanostraw substrate and a machine-aligned titanium electrode array. Across thirty automated cycles, the device demonstrated robust mechanical stability, reproducible timing (556 ± 12 s per run), and mesh-independent electric-field uniformity between titanium and platinum electrodes (MSE &lt; 0.1 V/m). Electrochemical analysis confirmed the safety of titanium operation in RPMI, and dimensional validation verified consistent alignment across modules. Together, these results establish a wet-lab-ready automated transfection backbone capable of supporting high-throughput, low-perturbation engineering of immune cells, laying the foundation for decentralized, scalable, and clinically compatible non-viral manufacturing of next-generation allogeneic therapies.

        <p>
          <b>Research Context.</b> Engineered immune-cell therapies have transformed oncology
          by demonstrating that synthetic genetic reprogramming can endow effector cells with
          potent, tumor-specific cytotoxicity <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Among these, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
          T-cell therapy stands as the most successful example—six products have gained 
          regulatory approval to date for the treatment of aggressive malignancies <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, such as
          relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma <a href="#ref3">[3,</a><a href="#ref4">4]</a> and multiple myeloma <a href="#ref5">[5,</a><a href="#ref6">6]</a>. This 
          approach harnesses a patient’s own immune system to selectively recognize and 
          eliminate tumor cells, overcoming limitations of traditional cancer treatments <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>
          such as surgery <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, radiotherapy <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>, and chemotherapy<a href="#ref10">[10]</a>, which often lack selectivity and 
          efficacy against advanced or disseminated disease. Reflecting its impact, the 
          global cell therapy market—estimated at US$25 billion in 2025—is projected to 
          exceed US$117 billion by 2034 <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>, driven by expansion into solid tumors <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>, 
          autoimmune disorders <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>, and infectious diseases <a href="#ref13">[13]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these clinical successes, the field remains constrained by a fundamental
          manufacturing bottleneck. As of June 2023, more than 1300 clinical trials of CAR-T
          and related therapies were registered, approximately 93% of which employ autologous
          manufacturing pipelines <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>. Such patient-specific production is logistically fragile and
          economically prohibitive (US$0.4–1 million per treatment), limiting access to roughly
          20% of prescribed patients <a href="#ref14">[14,</a><a href="#ref15">15]</a>. Moreover, in real-world settings, manufacturing
          delays are so severe that ∼ 7% of patients die before receiving their infusion <a href="#ref15">[15]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core challenge lies in the transfection of primary immune cells—a critical step
          for introducing chimeric receptors or enabling precise genome edits. Current 
          delivery modalities impose intrinsic trade-offs: (1) Viral vectors suffer from 
          limited cargo capacity (∼ 5–15 kb), risks of random genomic integration, 
          immunogenicity, and costly cGMP-scale production <a href="#ref14">[14,</a><a href="#ref15">15]</a>. (2) Bulk electroporation 
          requires extremely high electric fields (tens to hundreds of kVcm−1), causing 
          Joule heating, calcium dysregulation, and transcriptional perturbations that 
          compromise cell viability and function <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>. Furthermore, current treatment relies 
          on centralized production models due to labor-intensive manual production and the 
          need to maintain consistent quality and minimize product variability <a href="#ref16">[16]</a>. Additionally, 
          QA/QC protocols are implemented due to concerns from the viral nature of the 
          treatment <a href="#ref17">[17]</a>. This contributes to long wait times and necessitates cryopreservation, 
          which can render some patients ineligible due to rapid deterioration in health and 
          reduction in CAR-T cell viability before infusion <a href="#ref16">[16]</a>. Current solutions to address 
          these challenges include automated devices such as CliniMac’s Prodigy<sup><a href="https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/SG-en/products/clinimacs-prodigy.html">1</a></sup> and
          Thermofisher CTS xenon system <sup><a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/sg/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-electroporation-system.html">2</a></sup>, but they are designed to produce one batch of dose per 
          cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the U.S. FDA projecting 10–20 new cell and gene therapy approvals annually
          by 2025<sup><a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fda-planning-new-guidance-hires-cell-and-gene-therapies-for-2019?">3</a></sup> and the allogeneic immune-cell therapy market expected to grow at a CAGR
          of ∼ 27.4%<sup><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/allogeneic-cell-therapy-market-report">4</a></sup>, there is an urgent need for scalable, non-viral, multipayload transfection
          technologies that preserve cellular integrity and integrate seamlessly into closed-loop
          automation.

          effector cells at scale—decoupled from viral intermediates, engineered for high

          Current manufacturing pipelines for CAR-T therapy remain expensive,

          seek to reduce production costs, ensure consistent product quality, and shorten 
          vein-to-vein time—ultimately enabling decentralized and more accessible 
          manufacturing of immune-cell therapies.

          Within the team, Tianmu will lead the development of the automation backbone, 
          focusing primarily on the design and optimization of the media-transportation 
          system. Celeste will concentrate on engineering the transfection module. 
          Both subsystems will be jointly integrated into a cohesive automated platform.

          <b>Project Scope.</b> Because the central objective is automation, our 
          validation strategy prioritizes engineering performance over deep biological 
          characterisation. Our key milestones are: (1) improving recovery efficiency 
          by minimizing residual volume and achieving a recovery rate above 50%; 
          (2) ensuring robust, stable and controllable system operation with a total 
          processing time under 10 minutes; and (3) minimizing system-induced cell 
          loss, maintaining viability above 70% when operating without 
          electroporation. Initial testing will use Jurkat cells, an immortalised 
          T-cel line with a rapid doubling time (1-2 days), allowing frequent 
          iterative prototyping. Performance across recovery, stability, and 
          viability will determine readiness for downstream optimization toward 
          bedside or on-bench automated immune-cell manufacturing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a further step, once engineering benchmarks are met, we plan to 
          incorporate in vitro experiments to refine system parameters for human 
          T-cell transfection using fluorescent dyes or non-functional protien-cargo, 
          producing a prototype positioned for biologically intensive refinement.

          to deliver a next-generation, scalable, and automated non-viral transfection 
          platform that can serve both clinical (bed-side) and research (on-bench) applications. No
          equivalent system currently exists on the market; our prototype therefore lays the
          foundational groundwork for a future universal immune-cell manufacturing device.
          (2) We expand our earlier single-well prototype into a 96-well system, increasing 
          production throughput by up to 96-fold. The redesigned platform incorporates standard
          laboratory consumables—including 96-well plates, pipette tips, and common medical
          springs—to ensure compatibility with existing laboratory workflows and enhance 
          clinical utility. (3) We introduce an innovative shift from media-based to 
          container-based transportation. This approach mitigates cell loss and residual 
          accumulation, two common issues in current bioreactor designs. By ensuring that cells are transferred in a
          highly preserved state, this method improves cell viability and significantly compresses
          the overall manufacturing timeline.

          <p>
            The automatic backbone aims to address cell loss and long production 
            times, targeting issues (1c), (2a) and (2b) (<a href="#Table-1">Table 1</a>). 
            It is expected to improve cell recovery, shorten the manufacturing 
            cycle, and in turn enhance cell quality, increase output volume, and 
            reduce the unit cost of CAR-T production. <a href="#Table-3">Table 3</a> 
            summarizes the design exploration of the automation backbone.
          </p>
          <div id="Cell-Transport">
          <p>
            <b>Cell transportation between sample reservoir and 96-well plate</b>
            To automate the transport of cells between the sample reservoir and the 
            96-well plate, we systematically compared two concept solutions: 
            (i) direct fluid transfer using peristaltic pumps and 
            (ii) container-based transport using a mechanical conveyor 
            (<i>transporter</i>). The primary design considerations were to 
            minimise cell loss, reduce shear stress, preserve sterility, and 
            ensure reproducible positioning over the nanostraw electroporation 
            region.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peristaltic pumps, although widely used in bioprocessing, impose 
            repeated compression--relaxation cycles and high shear stresses at the 
            tubing--roller interface. These conditions can decrease viability during 
            repeated transfers, while tubing surfaces introduce opportunities for 
            adhesion, entrapment in dead volumes, and uncontrolled residual loss. 
            Maintaining sterility requires frequent tubing replacement or cleaning, 
            adding operational complexity.
          </p>

          <p>
            To avoid these limitations, we adopted a conveyor-based transporter that 
            moves cells in fixed well-plate carriers with minimal bulk fluid 
            transfer. In this configuration, cells remain confined within standard 
            microplate wells, and only short, well-defined fluid paths are involved 
            during loading and unloading. This reduces surface area for adhesion, 
            eliminates cyclic compression, and minimises shear exposure, thereby 
            preserving cell integrity and yield. Because the wells serve as 
            disposable, closed carriers, sterility is maintained through consumable 
            exchange rather than extensive cleaning-in-place procedures. 
            Consequently, the transporter concept provides gentler handling, lower 
            residual loss, and improved reproducibility compared with peristaltic 
            pumping.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div id="Extract-Cell">
          <h3>Extraction and dispensing of cells</h3>
          <p>
            For extraction and dispensing of cells, we compared syringe-based 
            displacement against pipette-tip based transfer. While both approaches 
            can achieve accurate volumetric delivery, the dominant requirement was 
            minimising residual cell volume while maintaining compatibility with the 
            conveyor-based transport scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pipette tips are low-cost and common in laboratory workflows, but their 
            long, tapered channels and air--liquid interfaces can trap small volumes 
            of cell suspension near the tip orifice. This trapped residual varies 
            with aspiration speed, immersion depth, and tip alignment, introducing 
            uncertainty in the delivered dose. Frequent attachment and ejection of 
            tips also increase mechanical complexity and risk misalignment within 
            the constrained footprint of the automation backbone.
          </p>
          <p>
            We therefore selected syringe-driven displacement as the primary 
            extraction mechanism. The short and well-defined internal wetted 
            volume enables near-complete evacuation with minimal dead volume. 
            Piston-driven motion provides smooth, continuous flow profiles that 
            reduce bubble formation and shear stress. Syringes can be rigidly 
            integrated into the transport module, simplifying alignment with 
            reservoir and plate wells while maintaining a closed, sterilisable 
            flow path. Compared with pipette tips, syringe transfer offers lower 
            residual loss, improved flow controllability, and superior mechanical 
            integration.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div id="Spatial-Layout">
          <h3>Spatial layout of automation modules</h3>
          <p>
            The automation backbone integrates sample loading, plate transport, 
            and electroporation within a compact benchtop footprint. We evaluated 
            an L-shaped layout against a linear (``horizontal line'') configuration.
          </p>

          <p>
            An L-shaped layout requires the plate to undergo a 90&deg; directional change, 
            necessitating either a rotational stage or complex guiding features. These 
            additions increase mechanical complexity, introduce vibration sources, and 
            complicate cable routing. Directional changes may also induce sloshing, 
            perturbing cell distribution immediately before electroporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The horizontal-line configuration, by contrast, aligns the loading region, 
            electroporation zone, and unloading area along a single translational axis. 
            This simplifies mechanical design, minimises acceleration events, and reduces 
            inertial disturbances to the fluid. The linear layout also simplifies enclosure 
            design and allows future expansion (e.g., washing or incubation modules) along 
            the same axis. For these reasons, the horizontal-line configuration was 
            selected.

          <div id="#Actuation-Strategy">
          <h3>Actuation strategy for plate transport</h3>
          <p>To execute conveyor motion with sufficient smoothness and positional accuracy, 
            we evaluated belt-driven linear actuators against lead-screw linear actuators. 
            The key requirements included: (i) smooth, jerk-minimised motion, (ii) stable 
            pausing without unwanted drift, and (iii) repeatable positioning over the 
            nanostraw array.</p>
          <p>
            Belt-driven actuators offer high speed but introduce motion ripple and 
            micro-vibrations due to belt elasticity and periodic tooth engagement. 
            These effects are most problematic at low speeds and during start--stop 
            transitions, when fluid agitation is most likely. Belt stretch and wear 
            also compromise long-term positional stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lead-screw actuators, in contrast, rely on continuous rolling contact between the 
            threaded screw and nut, producing deterministic, vibration-free translation. Their 
            mechanical advantage allows fine-grained control of velocity and acceleration. The 
            self-locking nature of many lead-screw systems prevents unintended motion during 
            pauses, crucial for stable electroporation. Accordingly, we selected a lead-screw 
            linear actuator to ensure smooth transport, stable positioning, and high 
            repeatability.

            scalability limits, targeting (1a) and (1b) (<a href="#Table-1">Table 1</a>). It 
            supports the translation of the protocol for both clinical and research,

            <a href="#Table-5">Table 5</a> summarizes the design idea of the transfection 
            plate. The design of the transfection plate was guided by the above 
            requirements, along with sterility, and compatibility with the automated 
            workflow. Design alternatives for each functional component were evaluated 
            systematically, and the chosen solutions are justified below

          <div id="Cathode-Material">
          <h3>Material of cathode</h3>
          <p>
            Titanium was selected over platinum as the cathode material. Although 
            platinum offers excellent electrochemical stability, titanium provides 
            comparable biocompatibility and corrosion resistance at significantly 
            lower cost. Its naturally forming TiO<sub>2</sub> passivation layer 
            ensures stable performance under repeated electrical pulsing at 40-50V 
            in buffered media such as RPMI-1640, with demonstrated low cytotoxicity 
            in Jurkat or primary human T cells <a href="#ref19">[19,</a><a href="#ref20">20]</a>.

          <div id="Cargo-Channel-Design">
          <h3>Design of cargo distribution channels</h3>
          <p>
            Two designs were assessed: a one-input-to-one-channel configuration and a 
            one-input-to-two-channel configuration. Although the latter reduces the 
            number of filling steps, the presence of bifurcation junctions increases 
            the risk of stagnation, coagulation, and uneven hydraulic resistance. 
            These issues directly compromise volume and concentration uniformity 
            across channels. The one-input-to-one-channel design was therefore

          <h3>Material of cargo channel</h3>
          <p>
            We compared acrylic with M2R-CL, a medical-grade resin. Acrylic fabrication 
            typically requires multiple bonded layers, creating seams that trap proteins 
            and introduce alignment variability. M2R-CL, in contrast, enables the channel 
            module to be moulded as a single integrated structure with built-in alignment 
            features for the 96-well plate and ITO substrate. Its chemical inertness, 
            smooth surface, and mechanical robustness reduce protein adsorption and 
            enhance reproducibility in electroporation. Thus, M2R-CL was selected.

          <div id="Current-Delivery">
          <h3>Delivery of current to the ITO plate</h3>
          <p>
            Current delivery from the side of the ITO substrate was considered but 
            rejected due to the risk of scraping or damaging the fragile conductive 
            coating. Side-contact methods also tend to introduce edge-concentrated 
            current paths, reducing field uniformity across wells. A bottom-contact 
            configuration was chosen instead. This protects the ITO layer from 
            mechanical damage, supports uniform electrical distribution, and 
            simplifies assembly for the user.

          <h3>Consumable attachment mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            Latch-based mechanisms were compared with passive interlock structures. 
            Latches introduce moving components that increase assembly complexity, 
            tolerance stack-up, and risk of mis-seating—critical concerns when 
            aligning consumables above nanoscale electroporation structures. 
            Interlock geometries integrated directly into the cargo-channel 
            moulding provide stable, repeatable, and alignment-preserving attachment 
            without requiring user adjustments. This approach supports consistent 
            operation and facilitates automation.

            Double-sided tape was considered due to its ease of use, but it exhibits 
            variable sealing performance based on applied pressure and environmental 
            conditions. Medical-grade adhesive was chosen instead for forming a 
            continuous, hermetic, biocompatible seal. Its chemical stability ensures 
            resistance to electrical pulsing, prevents fluid leakage, and reduces 
            contamination risk, supporting consistent multi-layer bonding integrity.

          <a href="#Table-6">Table 6</a> summarizes the component resuability 
          considerations. The transfection plate comprises multiple layers that 
          directly contact patient-derived samples or form critical microfluidic and 
          electrical interfaces. Components that are permanently bonded or contain 
          micro-scale crevices—specifically the nano-straw membrane, well plate, cargo 
          channel, and ITO substrate—are unsuitable for reuse due to difficulties in 
          sterilisation, risk of contamination, and mechanical damage during 
          disassembly. These parts are therefore designated as single-use consumables 
          to ensure sterility and consistent electroporation performance.

          The anode (titanium electrode), however, is a monolithic metallic component 
          integrated into the device frame. Its smooth surface, corrosion resistance, 
          and absence of internal crevices enable reliable cleaning and disinfection 
          without compromising structural or electrical integrity. As such, the anode 
          is reusable, balancing material cost with safe and reproducible operation.

            <b>Device Fabrication.</b> We successfully designed, manufactured, assembled, 
            and tested a fully automated electroporation prototype that forms the mechanical 
            backbone of our non-viral immune-cell engineering platform <a href="#Figure-2">Fig.2</a>. 
            The system integrates four major subsystems: a linear conveyor belt driven by a 
            stepper motor with a positional precision of 0.1~mm, a reaction platform designed 
            to secure the sample reservoir and standard 96-well electroporation plates, a 
            two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) sample transporter, and a vertically aligned electrode 
            array composed of uniform-length electrodes. Together, these modules enable 
            programmable sample transportation, accurate plate positioning, and a consistent 
            electrode--cell interface crucial for reproducible electroporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The linear conveyor belt was adapted from a commercially available product and 
            mechanically modified to provide precise, automated shuttling of plates across 
            processing stations. The reaction platform was custom-fabricated from steel plates 
            and soldered to form a rigid, dimensionally accurate base compatible with standard 
            wet-lab consumables. The two-DOF sample transporter originated from a 
            perfume-injection mechanism; the original dispensing assembly was removed and 
            replaced with an eight-channel springe-based sampling array, allowing automated 
            media acquisition and delivery at tunable heights and lateral positions to 
            accommodate potential design iterations. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The electrode array was manufactured using a multistep workflow. A 5~mm-thick 
            white steel plate was first drilled to create a 2~mm hole array. Threaded screw 
            holders (2~mm outer diameter, 0.5~mm inner diameter) were then soldered into each
            hole, through which electrode wires were threaded and fixed in place. The back 
            side of the assembly was sealed by soldering a cap, ensuring uniform electrode 
            length, stable electrical continuity, and robust structural integrity.
          </p>

          <p>
            In parallel, we iterated the electroporation substrate to improve usability, 
            biocompatibility, and leak prevention. The assembly process was redesigned to 
            eliminate leakage, and the previous use of medical-grade tape as a bonding component 
            was replaced with biocompatible adhesive to enhance reliability and ease of use. The 
            ITO (indium tin oxide) plate was further modified to ensure efficient current 
            conduction from its base to the top surface. Conductive tape was applied and folded 
            along the rim of the ITO plate, and a two-layer adhesive strategy was implemented: 
            an initial layer of medical-grade glue was applied to isolate any non-biocompatible 
            tape residues, followed by a second adhesive layer bonding the ITO plate to the cargo 
            channel. Approximately 2~mm of conductive tape was intentionally left on the top 
            surface to preserve electrical contact, with careful control taken to avoid bubble 
            formation or tape overlap.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cargo channel was fabricated using MultiJet Printing (MJP).
            Although functional, the printed walls displayed warping due to low rigidity of 
            thin polymer sections. To ensure greater dimensional stability and sealing 
            performance during electroporation, we initiated development of an acrylic-based 
            version with improved structural stiffness. The 96-well plate and the MJP-printed 
            cargo channel have been fully procured, and procurement of the holder and metal 
            plate is underway following verification of the automated backbone's performance
              and design integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collectively, these engineering efforts yielded a fully fabricated, mechanically 
            validated, wet-lab-ready electroporation prototype integrating high-precision motion 
            control, a biocompatible and leak-free electroporation substrate, reliable current 
            delivery through a modified ITO interface, and a refined cargo transport system. 
            This completed prototype establishes the foundation for subsequent optimization and 
            testing.

            <b>Device Test.</b> This semester, we validated the mechanical and operational 
            robustness of the automated transfection platform as a prerequisite for biological 
            experimentation. System-level stability was assessed through thirty consecutive 
            automated runs, during which only a single failure was observed; importantly, this 
            failure was traced to temporary cable interference and has since been resolved 
            through hardware rerouting. Across all successful runs, the device demonstrated 
            consistent temporal performance, completing each automated cycle in 
            556 &plusmn; 12 s, indicating a high level of reproducibility in the 
            actuation sequence, media handling, and control logic. Collectively, these tests 
            confirm that the automation backbone is stable enough to support downstream wet-lab 
            studies.

            In parallel, we performed theoretical and empirical validation of the titanium 
            electrodes employed during electroporation. First, we simulated <i>in silicon</i> 
            the electric field and average electric field strength at transfection membrane and 
            found that across all meshes, the average electric field strength remained 
            negligibly different (p > 0.99; Mean Square Difference < 0.1 V/m; 
            <a href="#Figure-3">Fig.3c</a> Top Right). Next, theoretical computation (<a href="#Electrochemical-Analysis">Appendix</a>) confirmed pulsed 
            operation under the anticipated voltage and buffer conditions induced negligible 
            release of Ti<sup>4+</sup> ions, supporting the suitability of titanium as a 
            biocompatible anode material within the RPMI-based electroporation environment.
            Dimensional calibration of the mechanical assembly further verified that all 
            modular components fall within their designed tolerance envelopes, ensuring that 
            translational, rotational, and compression mechanisms operate without unintended 
            mechanical interference. These combined validations establish that the device 
            satisfies the machining precision and electrochemical safety requirements 
            necessary for biological deployment.

            With this foundation, the next stage of evaluation will focus on biological 
            readiness. The first objective is to quantify cell and media recovery throughout 
            the automated workflow, thereby demonstrating that the system can reliably execute
            the fluidic and mechanical steps that precede electroporation. This begins with a
            volume-recovery assay using water or PBS for rapid iteration and will be followed 
            by recovery tests using Jurkat cells in the absence of nanostraw membranes or 
            cargo to evaluate potential cell loss. Once recovery performance is confirmed, 
            the platform will be used to perform full transfection assays. Jurkat cells will 
            serve as the initial biological model, enabling verification that the device can 
            deliver fluorescent dyes or reporter proteins with measurable efficiency. 
            Subsequent experiments will extend to primary human T cells, where fluorescent 
            and functional protein delivery will allow us to assess the translational
            relevance of the system for immunotherapeutic manufacturing.

          <p>
            Together, the validated mechanical reliability, electrochemical safety, 
            dimensional precision, and the structured biological testing pipeline position 
            our platform as a wet-lab-ready prototype. The device is now functionally 
            prepared for transfection-focused iteration and represents a solid foundation 
            for future refinement toward clinically oriented non-viral engineering of CAR-T cells.

        <div id="Summary-and-Analysis">
          <p>
            <b>Summary and Analysis.</b> Our work demonstrates that a fully automated, non-viral 
            transfection platform for large-scale immune-cell engineering is both technically 
            feasible and operationally robust. Through systematic prototyping and iterative 
            testing, we established that the automation backbone—comprising conveyor-based 
            well-plate transport, syringe-driven media handling, and a custom electroporation 
            substrate—can already execute complete processing cycles with high stability and 
            reproducibility. Across thirty consecutive automated runs, the system maintained 
            consistent temporal performance with only a single failure, whose root cause was 
            identified and resolved. This confirms that our mechanical design, motion-control 
            strategy, and software--hardware integration are sufficiently mature to support 
            downstream biological experimentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parallel evaluation of the electroporation module further validated key theoretical 
            and engineering assumptions underpinning the device. Computational analysis revealed 
            that titanium and platinum electrodes generate indistinguishable electric-field 
            distributions at the transfection interface, and mesh-refinement studies confirmed 
            numerical convergence, indicating that our field predictions are physically reliable. 
            Experimental calibration of the titanium array verified uniform electrode length, 
            structural stability, and safe electrical behaviour in RPMI-based conditions, 
            supporting its suitability as a reusable anode. Together, these findings confirm 
            that the core mechanisms required for uniform field delivery—electrode alignment, 
            current continuity, and substrate integrity—are already in place.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Limitations">
          <p>
            <b>Limitations</b> Meanwhile, we would like to point out the limitations of our work. 
            First, the current prototype does not yet support automated control of the electrical 
            pulse. In the present design, the electroporation voltage remains continuously 
            applied, and the effective field strength experienced by cells is modulated 
            indirectly by adjusting the distance between the titanium electrodes and the 
            ITO substrate. While this quick fix enables preliminary testing, it provides 
            limited temporal specificity and does not reflect the pulsed-field regimes required 
            for optimal transfection efficiency. A more robust solution will involve integrating 
            a GPIO-controlled, programmable power delivery module to enable precise timing, 
            amplitude modulation, and waveform control during electroporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, a dimensional mismatch potentially remains between the electroporation 
            substrate and the media transporter. At this stage, positional calibration relies 
            on identifying appropriate coordinates in manual mode and subsequently updating the 
            automated control script with manually tuned parameters. Although functional, this 
            approach is not scalable and introduces susceptibility to small mechanical 
            deviations. To minimize the risk of damaging the fragile titanium electrodes during 
            alignment, we also employ low-cost steel prototypes during position tuning. Future 
            iterations will require tighter dimensional standardization between subsystems or 
            the incorporation of active sensing methods to ensure repeatable, self-correcting 
            alignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A third potential limitation concerns the presence of residual media within the 
            cargo channel or sampling interface. Variability in fluid acquisition and expulsion 
            can arise from suboptimal springe motion profiles, leading to inconsistent recovery 
            volumes or retention of trace liquid between cycles. This may be addressed by 
            further refining movement speed, acceleration, and positioning parameters for each 
            fluid-handling operation. Additionally, adopting disposable pipette tips as 
            intermediate media carriers may enhance reliability and reduce cross-contamination 
            risk while providing a more flexible and replaceable interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, while these limitations do not compromise the functional readiness of the 
            current prototype, addressing them will be critical for advancing the platform 
            toward high-precision, reliable, and fully automated non-viral transfection 
            suitable for routine experimental or translational use.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Future-Work">
          <p>
            <b>Future Work</b> Looking ahead, we will strengthen both the engineering 
            rigor and biological performance of our platform to support a robust, 
            fully automated electroporation system. Our efforts will focus on two 
            parallel streams: (a.)Biological validation: We will quantitatively assess cell recovery across the workflow, confirming 
            preservation of media volume, cell number, and viability using 
            standardized Trypan blue–based counting. Once the automated backbone 
            is confirmed stable, electroporation performance will be evaluated using 
            Jurkat cells with fluorescent dyes and proteins, and optionally extended 
            to primary T cells to assess translational potential. Detailed protocols 
            are provided in the Appendix <a href="#Future-Experiment-Protocol">Protocol</a>>. (b.)Engineering characterization: We will verify uniform current distribution across 
            titanium electrodes, ensure no fluid seepage within the consumables 
            assembly (well plate, nanostraw membrane, cargo channel, ITO substrate), 
            and characterize electric-field uniformity across wells during 
            electroporation. Integration within the automated framework will be 
            re-examined to confirm mechanical compatibility, electrical stability, 
            fluidic reliability, and software–hardware synchronization before the 
            next prototyping iteration.

            To upper-bound the extent of titanium dissolution during electroporation, we modelled the anode as a 0.5 mm-radius titanium disk immersed in a cylindrical RPMI-1640 domain of radius 6 mm and height 3 mm.

            strengths in RPMI-1640 and are unlikely to exert measurable cytotoxic or functional effects on

            <b>Jurkat cell recovery assay</b> To quantify recovery efficiency 
            following automated fluidic transport, exponentially growing Jurkat

            <b>Primary human T-cell transfection with fluorescent dye (Optional).</b>    
            Primary CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells will be activated for 48&nbsp;h using CTS&nbsp;ImmunoCult reagents in CTS&nbsp;OpTmizer T-cell expansion medium. 
            Activated T cells will be washed twice with PBS and resuspended in electroporation buffer at 8–10×10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;cells/mL. 
            Fluorescent dye will be prepared as described for Jurkat cells, and cells will be mixed with the dye immediately prior to loading. 
            One million cells will be dispensed into each well and subjected to the programmed electroporation waveform. 
            At the end of pulsing, 1&nbsp;mL of pre-warmed OpTmizer medium will be added to each well, and cells will be incubated under 37&deg;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 
            Dye uptake will be assessed by microscopy or flow cytometry 30–60&nbsp;min after electroporation.
          </p>

          <p><b>Primary human T-cell transfection with fluorescent protein (Optional).</b>
            Activated primary T cells will be processed in parallel for protein delivery. 
            After washing and resuspension at 8–10×10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;cells/mL, cells will be combined with recombinant fluorescent protein at a final concentration of 50–150&nbsp;&mu;g/mL. 
            A total of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells will be loaded into each well and subjected to the electroporation cycle. 
            Following electroporation, cells will be immediately transferred into OpTmizer medium and incubated for 4–6&nbsp;h to permit intracellular protein maturation and equilibrium. 
            Transfection efficiency will be quantified by flow cytometry, complemented by confocal imaging where required. 
            Cell viability for both dye and protein experiments will be determined using trypan blue or a fixable viability dye.
